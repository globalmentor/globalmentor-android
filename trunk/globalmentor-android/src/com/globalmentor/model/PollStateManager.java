/**
 * Manages a sequence of several states, allowing a consumer to poll for states, with state transitions occurring when needed. For example, this manager may
 * keep track of a number of image transition delays, increasing the delay after some amount of time has passed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each state, a minimum duration and a minimum number of polls may be supplied. A state will only transition after the minimum duration has passed
 * <em>and</em> the requested minimum number of polls has occurred. After the maximum duration or maximum poll count is reached, a transition always occurs.
 * Once the last state is reached, the state will not transition regardless of duration or polls.
 * </p>
 *

 * The same state may occur several times in the sequence.
 * </p>
 *

 * State transition does not occur asynchronously; the current state will be determined only when queried.

 * If there is at least one state defined, {@link #getState()} and {@link #pollState()} will never return <code>null</code>.
